              <h1>About OzoneRaaga</h1>
  <p>Ozone is a fusion band based in New Delhi India, which contain pure classical music from Indian culture and a fragrance of western music in it. Since the group was formed, in 2009, Ozone has steadily grown to become one of the most respected acts on the Indian music scene.</p>
              <p> Our sound is a mélange of the styles, moods and textures we have taken in from different cultures and different music styles of the world. Ozone is inspired by the famous band called ‘SHAKTI’. In our own way, we attempt to dissolve into the world we perceive, and discover music that resonates around us.</p>
<p> Many great musicians, especially in the Indian Classical arena, speak of the pursuit of that incredible moment during performance when the musician becomes the music and forgets his own identity. In our composition you will find the mixture of ragas with combination of western music together.</p>
